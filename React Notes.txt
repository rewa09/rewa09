React:
1)Jsx-html element in render method
2)React Fragment:
   to avoid creation of extra div while inspecting,react fragment is used.
   <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>
3)The value which we want or which is extracted from javascript is given by {}.
4)Template literals:
   use bactic and then ${}
   i.e {`${}`}
5)ContentEditable attribute:By using this we can edit content on UI
  usage:<h1 contentEditable="true"></h1>
6) To import all functions and variable from one file use "* as ___(any name in blank space)".
7)if default is used once for exporting then other time while exporting default is not used
